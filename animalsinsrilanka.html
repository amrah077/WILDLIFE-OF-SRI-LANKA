                        Large tree squirrels of the grizzled giant squirrel species are indigenous to southern India and Sri Lanka. Although it is regarded as one of the country's unofficial national animals, habitat loss and hunting are thought to be the main threats to its extinction.

                        It is a vibrantly coloured Corvidae species that is unique to Sri Lanka. This species is extremely active and nimble because it is adapted to hunting in the dense canopy. However, it is rarely used for long-distance flying due to its weak flight.

                        One of the blue whale's subspecies is the pygmy. It is restricted to the southern Pacific and Indian oceans, in contrast to its enormous counterpart. Even though it goes by the name "pygmy," it is still a very big animal, growing up to 24 metres (79 feet) in length.

                        Another large mammal found in the nation is the Sri Lankan sloth bear, which coexists with the Sri Lankan leopard for the most part of its range.

                        One subspecies of leopard that is indigenous to Sri Lanka is the Sri Lankan leopard. Since 2020, it has been deemed vulnerable to extinction, and the 800 or so individuals that make up its low population are still in decline.
