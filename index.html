The island's vegetation types are primarily influenced by its topography and climate.<br><br> One of the most amazing locations for plant enthusiasts to visit is the vast and immaculate Peradeniya Botanic Gardens. The gardens feature more than 4,000 distinct plant species, which are thought to be the best in all of Asia.<br>

                However, indiscriminate exploitation is causing a rapid depletion of tree species like ebony, mahogany,
                 satinwood, and teak as well as wildlife like elephants, leopards, bears, buffalo, and peafowl.Sri Lanka is also thought to be the greatest location on Earth to see blue whales, the largest animals to have ever lived.<br><br>

            <div class="flex">
             <div><p class="boxaround">Many endemic species found in Sri Lanka are threatened by habitat loss, poaching, and conflicts
               between humans and wildlife. The nation has made major efforts in conservation to address these issues.
                Many species, including the Asian elephant, the Sri Lankan leopard, and many bird species, depend on
                national parks like Wilpattu, Udawalawe, and Yala as their home. Anti-poaching patrols, habitat
                 restoration initiatives, and community engagement programmes are examples of conservation initiatives in
                 these parks that work to foster wildlife coexistence with nearby communities.<br><br>
                 In addition, Sri Lanka has put programmes and policies in place to safeguard endangered species. Wildlife
                 corridors were created across the nation to help animals move between dispersed habitats, thereby lowering
                  isolation and increasing genetic diversity.
