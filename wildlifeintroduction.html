                 <p class="boxaround2">One of Sri Lanka's least altered and biologically distinctive lowland rain forests is Sinharaja.
                    It is a national park in Sri Lanka and a hotspot for biodiversity. UNESCO has named it a World Heritage
                    Site and Biosphere Reserve, indicating its international significance.This dense rain forest, which is
                     close to Ratnapura, is home to an incredible array of natural wonders. These include refreshing waterfalls,
                      swift-moving streams, and pure freshwater streams.<br><br>
                    Although leopards are extremely rare to see in person, their frequent presence has been verified by
                    tracks and other indicators. The most uncommon birds in Sri Lanka are the Green-billed Coucal, the rarest
                    of all Sri Lankan birds, the Ashy-headed Barbbler, the Red-faced Malkoha, the Sri Lanka Blue Magpie, and
                    the White-headed Starling.<br><br> 
                    Visitors can find a comfortable accomodation in the Sinharaja Forest Edge hotel, located only 6.3km away from
                     the forest site.

                        Wasgamuwa National Park is situated 225 kilometres from Colombo in the districts of Matale and Polonnaruwa.
Rivers almost entirely surround the park, and its natural beauty is further enhanced by the small mountain
range of the Sudu Kanda and the small streams that follow it. <br><br>

As early as 1938, a portion of Wasgamuwa was designated as a Strict Nature Reserve. There is a wide variety
of wildlife in the park because of the early conservation efforts. Wasgamuwa is home to 140 species of birds
and 23 species of mammals.Large herds of Sri Lankan axis deers and water buffalos are frequently spotted in
this area. Wasgamuwa is well-known as the place for elephant herds and sloth bear spotting.<br><br>

Visitors are provided a Safari jeep and a tourguide for the tour.Three wildlife bungalows can be found in
Wasgamuwa National Park: Kadurupitiya, Mahaweli, and Wawul Ebe. Accommodation would therefore not be a problem.<br><br>
